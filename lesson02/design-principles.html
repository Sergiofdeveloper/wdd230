            <img src="images/rule-of-thirds.jpg" alt="rule-of-thirds" class="card-image">
            <p>To use this rule, we only have to divide the image with 2 horizontal and 2 vertical lines of equal thickness, 
                thus we will have nine similar rectangles and we will obtain four points where the lines 
                will meet, these are known as strong or main points of the image . 
                At these points is where we will place the most important elements of the design,
                the first that the user or viewer will see. On this website the first thing that the human eye notices is the 
                content at the top left where the course information is located.</p>

            <img src="images/visual-hierarchy.jpg" alt="visual-hierarchy" class="card-image">
            <p>One way to establish a visual hierarchy in content is the use of colors. We can emphasize certain areas of the composition
                 by using highly saturated primary colors, which irresistibly attract the attention of the spectators, always taking care 
                 that the texts contained therein contrast clearly with the background, so that they can be read clearly, as used on this website</p>

            <img src="images/fitts-law.jpg" alt="Fitt´s law" class="card-image">
            <p>Fitts' Law allows you to calculate the time a user needs to calculate a target based on the size and distance of the target. 
                Therefore, the most relevant actions on a website should be as close as possible to the position from which the cursor starts.
                In this case the surface on which the user can click is large enough and of course, much larger than the size of the cursor.
                And the cursor´s starting point is near the main button. </p>
